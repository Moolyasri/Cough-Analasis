# Cough-Analasis 
# Cough Disease Detection System

## Project Overview
A web application that analyzes cough sounds to detect respiratory diseases using machine learning. The system records or accepts audio input and provides detailed health assessments including disease prediction, symptoms, and recommendations.

## Key Features
1. **Audio Input**
   - Live recording through microphone
   - File upload support (WAV, MP3, M4A, WEBM)
   - Audio processing and storage

2. **Disease Detection**
   - Analyzes cough patterns
   - Detects multiple conditions:
     - COVID-19
     - Pneumonia
     - Bronchitis
     - Common Cold
     - Healthy State

3. **Analysis Output**
   - Disease prediction with confidence score
   - Detailed symptoms list
   - Treatment recommendations
   - Severity assessment
   - Recovery timeline
   - Contagion information

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Interactive web interface
- Real-time audio recording
- Dynamic result display
- Progress indicators

### Backend (Python/Flask)
- Audio file handling
- ML model integration
- Data processing
- Result generation

### Data Processing
- Audio feature extraction
- Consistent prediction for identical inputs
- Hash-based audio identification
- Result storage and retrieval

## How It Works
1. User provides audio input (recording/upload)
2. System processes and stores audio
3. Analyzes cough patterns
4. Generates comprehensive health assessment
5. Displays detailed results with recommendations

## Use Cases
- Preliminary health screening
- Remote health assessment
- Regular health monitoring
- Early disease detection

## Benefits
- Non-invasive diagnosis
- Quick health assessment
- Detailed health information
- Consistent results
- User-friendly interface
